Yapmeister is a **desktop app for managing tasks, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Yapmeister is the app's titular character. He was supposed to
have a personality, but it was dropped because of the _Great Assignment Calamity_[^1].
